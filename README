# SETUP
## DESKTOP

The project is configured to use the ldd linker for windows and linux targets, as linking is slow and ldd is much faster than the default linker on those systems.
See comments in .carg/config.toml for installing the necessary packages

## WASM

### SETUP

`rustup target install wasm32-unknown-unknown`
`cargo install wasm-server-runner`

### RUNNING
cargo run --no-default-features --features wasm --features serde --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# RUN
`cargo run`
