Leyline is a cooperative first person action RPG. 

In Leyline, you are an arcanist, and you are trying to straighten out leylines that have become disordered due to demonic activity.

Leylines are the source of magic in the world. They can channel it into the world, or, if improperly arranged, out of the world.

On each mission, you will solve a puzzle which realigned the leystones, allowing magicka to again flow properly.

But beware - the demons don't want these leylines to be fixed. They're trying to stop you!
